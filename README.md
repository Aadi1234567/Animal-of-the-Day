Animal of the Day:
Dogs are friendly and ferocious canines. There are all sorts of breeds, for example, Beagle, Siberian Husky, German Shepherd, and so on. These dogs are categorized into a few groups. Like the Siberian Husky and the German Shepherd is are working dogs, while the Beagle is hound, etc. Dogs first started off in Europe, then I believe around the 1800â€™s there were dogs all over the world! If you want to learn more on dogs there is a Brainpop movie on them. And if you want to get a dog I suggest to get a Goldendoodle. These lovable canines are a mix between a Poodle and a Golden Retriever. They don't shed a lot and they are friendly towards kids!
